# gronk
[FRC Robot program](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html) written in Java designed to control Prosper Robotics 2024 offseason robot gronk - an SDS MK4i Kraken Motor swerve drive. The robot was designed for the 2024 FRC Season's game: [Cresdendo](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season).

Once the robot code is fairly complete I will update the README.
